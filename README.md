**DiffExpression** 
The folder contains all files required by the [KNIME4NGS\_Test\_DiffExpression](https://github.com/ibisngs/knime4ngs/raw/master/KNIME4NGS_Test_DiffExpression.zip) workflow.
The data used in this workflow was generated by a RNA-seq experiment which aimed to identify transcriptomic changes in four primary human airwary smooth muscle cells treated with dexamethasone.
For more description of the experiment see the [PubMed entry 24926665](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926665) and for raw data see the [GEO entry GSE52778](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52778).
- SRR*.fastq.gz: RNA-seq read pairs of 8 individuals.
- diff_exp_fastq.list: List of all paired FastQ files. Serves as input for the FileLoader node.
- sample_cond.tsv: Assignment of each of the 8 samples to the treated (dex) or untreated (untrt) group.
- Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.chr16.gtf.gz: Annotation file needed for the FeatureCounts node.

**Exome_VarCal**
The folder contains the FastQ files which serve as input for the [KNIME4NGS\_Exome\_VarCal](https://github.com/ibisngs/knime4ngs/raw/master/KNIME4NGS_Test_Exome_VarCal.zip) workflow.
The files have been generated based on the Platinum Genomes offered by Illumina.
For more information visit the [Platinum Genomes website](http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/) and for raw data see the [ENA entry ERP001960](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP001960).

**RefGenome**
The folder contains chromosome 16 of the human reference genome (GRCh37) provided by [UCSC](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/).
Besides the main FastA file, we provide the index file and the corresponding sequencing dictionary.

**VariantSets**
The folder contains VCF files serving as databases of known polymorphic sites required by the GATKRealignment and the GATKBaseRecalibration nodes.
For more information see the [GATK documentation on how to use known variant sets](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=1247).
